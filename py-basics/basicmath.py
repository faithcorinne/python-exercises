# Exercise - Arithmetic Operator
# The goal of this exercise is to become familiar with the most common Python operators

# 1. Add 5 + 6
print('5 + 6 = ' + str(5 + 6))

# 2. Subtract 16 and 5
print('16 - 5 =' + str(16 - 5))

# 3. Multiply 5 by 3
print('5 * 3 = ' + str(5 * 3))

# 4. Divide 13 by 2
print('13 / 2 = ' + str(13 / 2))

# 5. Floor division 13 by 2
print('13 // 2 = ' + str(13 // 2))

# 6. Modulus 19 by 7
print('19 % 7 = ' + str(19 % 7))

# Exercise - Comparison Operator
# The goal of this exercise is to become comfortable with comparison operators

# 1. 3 is greater than 21
print('The statement 3 > 21 is ' + str(3 > 21))

# 2. 4 is greater than or equal to 12
print('The statement 4 >= 12 is ' + str(4 >= 12))

# 3. 40 is lesser than 221
print('The statement 40 < 221 is ' + str(40 < 221))

# 4. 12 is lesser than or equal to 13
print('The statement 12 <= 13 is ' + str(12 <= 13))

# 5. 26 is equal to 26
print('The statement 26 == 26 is ' + str(26 == 26))

# 6. 5 is not equal to 12
print('The statement 5 != 12 is ' + str(5 != 12))

# Exercise - Logical operators
# The goal of this exercise is to become familiarized with logical operators in the context of Python

# 1. (3 is greater than 21) and (56 is equal to 23)
print('The statement (3 > 21) AND (56 == 23) is ' + str((3 > 21) and (56 == 23)))

# 2. (4 is greater than or equal to 12) or (43 is lesser than or equal to 122)
print('The statement (4 >= 12) OR (43 <= 122) is ' + str((4 >= 12) or (43 <= 122)))

# 3. (40 is lesser than 221) and (34 is not equal to 34)
print('The statement (40 < 221) AND (34 != 34) is ' + str((40 < 221) and (34 != 34)))


# 4. (12 is lesser than or equal to 13) and (54 is greater than 23)
print('The statement (12 <= 13) AND (54 > 23) is ' + str((12 < 13) and (54 > 23)))

# 5. (26 is equal to 26) or (89 is not equal to 44)
print('The statement (26 == 26) OR (89 != 44) is ' + str((26 == 26) or (89 != 44)))

# 6. (5 is not equal to 12) and (67 is lesser than 88)
print('The statement (5 != 12) AND (67 < 88) is ' + str((5 != 12) and (67 < 88)))
